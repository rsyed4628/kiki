2. Git is a version control system.
3. It helps track changes in source code.
4. I can use 'git init' to create a new repository.
5. 'git add .' moves changes to the staging area.
6. 'git commit -m "message"' saves the changes locally.
7. 'git push' sends my commits to GitHub.
8. 'git pull' brings the latest changes from the remote.
9. Every developer uses Git in real projects.
10. Practice makes you confident with Git commands.
